# A simple graph problem for anyone to solve

## Problem A
Implement a simple graph from a predetermined structure. Fill in the gaps, and make the tests succeed.

## Problem B
Optimize the graph such that GetIncomingEdges is O(n) time complexity. Feel free to change the graph structure

## Problem C (Optional)
Implement BFS on the graph by preference.
